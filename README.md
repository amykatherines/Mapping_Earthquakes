# Earthquake Mapping Challenge

In subfolder "Earthquake_Challenge", you will find an updated Index.html and static/js/Challenge_logic.js file for this exercise.  Per the instructions of the challenge, the following changes were made the starter code:

1.  The tectonic plates are added and visible with dark blue lines.  The layer can be turned off or on using the control in the upper right corner.
2.  The Major Earthquakes are displayed as circle markers in aqua, fushia  and lime green.  There are no popup displays for these markers.  The major earthquakes are displayed on page load but they can be toggled off or on in the control in the upper right.
3.  The night navigation layer was added to the options for tile layers.  The Night Navigation is now the default when the page loads.
